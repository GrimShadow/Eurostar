# Rules and Triggers

## Train Status Rules
In this section, users can create rules that automatically change train statuses based on conditions like time, current status, or train properties.

### Creating new Rules
To create a rule, the user can use the Create New Rule section by supplying conditional information for the rule.

The basic principal of a rule is to have the following:

- **A Condition type:** A condition type is split up into different objects such as:
  - Time until departure
  - Time after departure
  - Time until arrival
  - Time after arrival
  - Current Status
  - Train number
  
- **A Operator:**
- **A Value:**
