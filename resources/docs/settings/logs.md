# Logs

The **Logs** view provides access to all system activity records across the **SignaRail** platform.
This section allows users to **view**, **analyze**, and **export** log data for troubleshooting, monitoring, and administrative review.

## Understanding Logs

System logs are automatically categorized into three distinct levels of severity:

* **Information** – General operational events that indicate normal system activity.
* **Warning** – Events that may indicate a potential issue or require user attention.
* **Error** – Events that represent a failure, misconfiguration, or interrupted process.

Each log entry represents a transaction or event recorded according to the configuration defined in the **Admin Settings** section.

Users may filter logs by selecting the radio buttons at the top of the logs view. These filters are as follows:

- **All**
- **Errors**
- **Info**

## Exporting Logs

Logs can be exported for diagnostic or reporting purposes.
Exported logs are saved as **text files**, which can then be shared with other system administrators or the **SignaRail Support Team** for further analysis.

To export logs:

1. Navigate to the **Logs** view.
2. Click the **Export Logs** button.
3. Choose a save location for the text file.

## Deleting Logs

If required, users can permanently remove log data from the system.
Deleting logs may be useful for housekeeping or data management but should be done with caution, as the information cannot be recovered once deleted.

To delete logs:

1. Navigate to the **Logs** view.
2. Click the **Clear Logs** button.
3. Confirm the deletion when prompted.
