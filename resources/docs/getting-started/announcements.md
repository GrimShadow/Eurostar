* **Time** – The time the announcement was triggered.

## Creating a New Announcement

Users can create **manual announcements** when needed for their assigned stations.
Access permissions determine which **stations and zones** a user can make announcements in—these are configured in the user’s profile.

To create a new announcement:

1. Click the **New Announcement** button.
2. Follow the steps in the **Announcement Wizard**.

### Announcement Type

In the Announcement Wizard, select an **Announcement Type** from the dropdown menu.
Each type corresponds to a **template** defined in the **Aviavox Settings** page.

Different templates may require specific additional details before the announcement can be submitted.

---

### Variables

Depending on the **selected Announcement Type**, the wizard will prompt the user to fill in one or more **variables**.
Common variables include:

* **Time**
* **Zone**
* **Platform**
* **Reason**

Each template defines its own required variables, which are displayed dynamically once an announcement type is selected.

## Summary

After completing all fields, review the summary page in the wizard to confirm the announcement details.
Once confirmed, the system will either **play** the announcement immediately or **schedule** it based on the provided time and zone configuration.
